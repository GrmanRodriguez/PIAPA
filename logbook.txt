The Raspberry Pi was connected to the Rover through the L298 drivers. rasp_mots.py (commit: ba23b466729ac75949227a090a294037d93cc3b6) was ran. The Rover's wheels moved accordingly as seen on this link: https://youtu.be/SFIwYYLxcLU However, the motors must be marked to know which pin makes their respective wheel move forward, as wheel motion was unclear. Next step is making the system battery-powered and take care of cable management.
