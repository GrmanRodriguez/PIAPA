**Sept 14th, 2017:**

The Raspberry Pi was connected to the Rover through the L298 drivers. raspMots.py (commit: ba23b466729ac75949227a090a294037d93cc3b6) was ran. The Rover's wheels moved accordingly as seen on [here](https://youtu.be/SFIwYYLxcLU). However, the motors must be marked to know which pin makes their respective wheel move forward, as wheel motion was unclear. Next step is making the system battery-powered and take care of cable management.

The motors have been properly marked and now the robot has a sense of forward. The pins that make each wheel move forward have been properly identified as well.
